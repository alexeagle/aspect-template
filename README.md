# Scaffold for basic Aspect Workflows project

Create a new project from scratch on macos:

```
% brew install aspect-build/aspect/aspect
% aspect init
```

Note, it's also possible to run this outside of `aspect init` using [scaffold](https://hay-kot.github.io/scaffold/) like so:

```shell
% brew tap hay-kot/scaffold-tap
% brew install scaffold
% scaffold new https://github.com/aspect-build/aspect-workflows-template.git
```
